# COMP3010 - BOTSv3 Incident Analysis & Presentation

## Introduction
In this report I will be covering an investigation I took on with the BOTSv3 dataset using Splunk Enterprise. 

My goal for this investigation was to use Splunk to identify and gather evidence regarding suspicious or misconfigured activity across AWS and such endpoints. 

Following this, I will be documenting my findings in a threat intelligence style report suitable for a SOC and Security Management audience.

My objectives were as such:
•	Set up Splunk Enterprise to digest and confirm the datasets coverage.

•	Identify AWS identity activity and relevant authentication context regarding MFA.

•	Investigate an S3 public access misconfiguration actions associated with it.

•	Identify endpoint anomalies in host OS information.

For my SOC interpretation, and for the basis of this report. I will be answering one set of the level 200 questions provided by the BOTSv3 team, alongside documenting my findings and showing clear and relevant evidence for each question.
